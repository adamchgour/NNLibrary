# NNLibrary

NNLibrary is a lightweight neural network library written in C++. It provides tools to build, train, and evaluate neural networks with customizable layers, activation functions, and loss functions.

## Features
- Support for multiple activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.).
- Various loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy, Binary Cross-Entropy, Hinge Loss).
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Modular design for adding layers and configuring networks.
- Example implementation for XOR problem.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using a C++ compiler (e.g., clang++).
3. Run the example in `src/main.cpp` to see the library in action.

## Example
The library includes an example that trains a neural network to solve the XOR problem. Check `src/main.cpp` for details.

## Requirements
- C++14 or later.
- A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., clang++ or g++).
